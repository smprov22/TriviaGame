# TriviaGame

For this project we were asked to make a 10 question trivia game.  We could theme it and style it however we wanted.  I chose a Pixar theme for my game. There are 10 questions and you have 10 seconds to answer each question before time runs out.  After each question an answer page comes up telling you if you got the question right, wrong, or ran out of time.  After all 10 questions have been answered (or if time runs out on the last question) the final score page is revealed and tells you the number of questions you got right/wrong/unanswered.  There is also the option to play again.  I also added music to the page that the player can listen to if they choose.

This game was made with a little HTML, a good amout of CSS, and a LOT of javascript/jQuery. The HTML is dynamically updated with each question and the answer page is different depending on whether or not the player answered the question correctly, incorrectly, or ran out of time.  There is also a gif that appears on the answer page that is related to the movie that question came from.  Finally, the javascript tracks how many answers the player got right, wrong, or didn't answer and gives you a final score. 

The hardest part of this project was dynamically updating the HTML from my questions/answers array.  Getting the HTML to display the right question, with the right answer and the right gif took a lot of trial and error.  I learned a lot about scope and creative ways to use loops and functions in this project.
